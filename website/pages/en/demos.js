              To illustrate the potential of Backstage, we’re showing you <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2020/04/21/how-we-use-backstage-at-spotify/">how we use it here at Spotify</a>. The videos below feature the custom plugins and templates that we built for our internal version of Backstage. You can use Backstage to build the developer portal you want — integrating the tools that you use in your own infrastructure ecosystem. (Or get started by building an open source plugin for Backstage that everyone can use, like our <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/04/06/lighthouse-plugin">Lighthouse Plugin</a>.)

            <Block.Title>Introduction to Backstage</Block.Title>
            <Block.Paragraph>Backstage is an open source platform for building developer portals. We’ve been using our homegrown version at Spotify for years — so it’s already packed with features. (We have over 120 internal plugins, built by 60 different teams.) In this live demo recording, Stefan Ålund, product manager for Backstage, tells the origin story of Backstage and gives you a tour of how we use it here at Spotify.</Block.Paragraph>

            <Block.Paragraph>You’re a Spotify engineer about to build a new microservice (or any component) using Spring Boot. Where do you start? Search for a quick start guide online? Create an empty repo on GitHub? Copy and paste an old project? Nope. Just go to Backstage, and you’ll be up and running in two minutes — with a “Hello World” app, CI, and documentation all automatically set up and configured in a standardized way.</Block.Paragraph>

            <Block.Paragraph>
              All of Spotify’s services are automatically indexed in Backstage. So our engineers can stop playing detective — no more spamming Slack channels asking if anyone knows who owns a particular service and where you can find its API, only to discover that the owner went on sabbatical three months ago and you have to hunt them down on a mountain in Tibet where they’re on a 12-day silent meditation retreat. At Spotify, anyone can always find anyone else’s service, inspect its APIs, and contact its current owner — all with one search.

          <Block.Paragraph>We manage a lot of data pipelines (also known as workflows) here at Spotify. So, of course, we made a great workflows plugin for our version of Backstage. All our workflow tools — including a scheduler, log inspector, data lineage graph, and configurable alerts — are integrated into one simple interface.</Block.Paragraph>
